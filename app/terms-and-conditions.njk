		<p>Carladies Limited is committed to providing quality services to you and this policy outlines our ongoing obligations to you in respect of how we manage your Personal Information.</p>
<p>The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaces the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and Data protection legislation (Data Protection Act 1998 - the Act”) in the UK and is designed to harmonise data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens’ data privacy and to reshape the way organisations across the region approach data privacy.</p>
<p>It aims to protect the rights of individuals to ensure that their personal information remains private and secure.</p>
<p>It provides individuals with a number of rights, including a right to access information and correct any errors. The Information Commissioner has an active role in educating the public and organisations about the data protection legislation, assisting data subjects in enforcing their rights, and imposing sanctions and enforcement actions against those who breach the legislation. </p>

		<h2 class="content-section__title">Cancellation under the Distance Selling Regulations</h2>
		<p>Ordinarily we do not run an organised distance selling scheme. However, due to the corona virus outbreak we need to support our valued customers by delivering your vehicle to your home.</p>
<p>If you have ordered and taken delivery of your vehicle without visiting our showroom and you are not buying the car in the course of your trade or business, the following cancellation clause applies:</p>
<p>You have 14 days to get to know your new vehicle and to make sure it suits you.</p>
<p>  If you change your mind just let us know in writing by post to
Car Ladies ltd Unit 2c Cowm top business park Cowm top lane Rochdale OL11 2QA  or by email to sales@badcreditnewcar.co.uk and to reach us by 6pm on the 14th day following delivery.</p>
<p>
If you cancel a contract on this basis, you must promptly return the vehicle to us, in the same condition in which you received it. We must receive the vehicle back within 7 days of your written notice of cancellation. If you do change your mind you cannot use the car once you have notified us, only for delivery back to us. You must still tax and insure the vehicle until it is returned to us.
We cannot accept a return of the car if it has been damaged, modified or altered from the condition it was delivered in.
You are liable for the vehicle from the point of accepting delivery. If you choose to cancel within your cooling off period, then you remain liable for the vehicle until we have signed to accept it from you.
You will be liable, and charged, for any damage present which was not noted when you accepted delivery of the vehicle. Any cost will be deducted from your final refund amount.
Any delivery cost charged to you as part of your order will be fully refunded. However, you will be liable for any collection costs incurred and this amount will be deducted from your final refund. We will fully inform you of any costs before arranging collection and will not make any arrangements without your prior consent.
You are able to make your own arrangements for return of the vehicle but, in doing so, accept full liability for the vehicle until one of our selected collection companies have signed to accept it from you.
Any damage caused to the vehicle will be deducted from your final refund amount and, in the case of any insurance claim being raised, no refund will be made until payout from the relevant insurance company has been made to us. No refund amount will be made until the vehicle has been inspected and signed for by a member of our team. If we intend to make any deductions from your final refund amount, then you will be made aware of that amount prior to the refund.
An excess mileage charge of £1.50 plus VAT per mile for any mileage over 50 miles in those 14 days will apply.  The mileage reading will be taken at point of collection. If you choose to not pay the cost for us to collect and you decide to bring the car back yourself, then the return mileage reading will be taken at our premises at point of handover.
For reasons of fraud prevention, we are only able to deliver to your home address and, prior to arranging delivery, Will require your driver’s licence and proof of address to be verified, we will not deliver the car to you if we have not received this.
Upon receipt of your vehicle it is imperative that you fully inspect its physical condition. Once you have signed to accept the vehicle we will, unfortunately, not accept liability for any damage which was not noted during your vehicle’s delivery.
This cancellation (change of mind) clause does not affect any separate rights given to you in The Consumer Rights Act 2015 or the Sale of Goods Act 1979 (as amended).</p>
